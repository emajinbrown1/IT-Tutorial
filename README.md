**Software Development** is a process by which a standalone or indivdual software is created using a specific programming language

>Software development is the collective processes involved in creating software programs, embodying all the stages throughout the systems development life cycle (SDLC).

*For beginners to software development*

#### What is SDLC?
>SDLC or the Software Development Life Cycle is a process that produces software with the highest quality and lowest cost in the shortest time. SDLC includes a detailed plan for how to develop, alter, maintain, and replace a software system.

#### How SDLC Works
>SDLC works by lowering the cost of software development while simultaneously improving quality and shortening production time. SDLC achieves these apparently divergent goals by following a plan that removes the typical pitfalls to software development projects. That plan starts by evaluating existing systems for deficiencies. Next, it defines the requirements of the new system. It then creates the software through the stages of design, development, testing, and deployment. By anticipating costly mistakes like failing to ask the end user for suggestions, SLDC can eliminate redundant rework and after-the-fact fixes.

#### Stages and Best Practices of SDLC
1. Identifying the current problems
2. Plan
3. Design
4. Build
5. Test
6. Deploy
7. Maintain
